# ZiphianPaperClips

** Requires matplotlib for making graphs. http://matplotlib.org/ **

An interesting little program to generate exponential-ish datasets from random numbers and virtual chains of paperclips

The idea for this came from this video: https://youtu.be/fCn8zs912OE?t=13m26s

It has something to do with Ziph's law. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law basically, after the right ammount of iterations, the paperclip chain lengths will make a nice curve.
